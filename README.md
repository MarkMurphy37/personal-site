#MarkMurphy.io

Hi there! 👋🏼

This is my [personal site](https://markmurphy.io) built with GatsbyJS, ReactJS, GraphQL. I used the default Gatsby starter as a base. 

If you'd like to try out the GatsbyJS for yourself just follow the steps below. 👇🏼

## gatsby-starter-default
The default Gatsby starter.

For an overview of the project structure please refer to the [Gatsby documentation - Building with Components](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/building-with-components/).

## Install

Make sure that you have the Gatsby CLI program installed:
```sh
npm install --global gatsby-cli
```

And run from your CLI:
```sh
gatsby new gatsby-example-site
```

Then you can run it by:
```sh
cd gatsby-example-site
gatsby develop
```
